## About Me
👋 Hi, I’m Vivek Das

I lead teams in translational omics and data science that directly influence clinical decision-making across cardiometabolic and neurological programs. My work bridges computational biology, ML/AI, and integrated clinical data to enable key decisions in late-stage clinical development. I also mentor and collaborate with scientists worldwide.

💻 Previously, I also worked on omics projects involving preclinical data with interventional designs e.g., knockout or drug-treated at single cell or bulk multi-omics level

💞️ I also collaborate on developing applied machine learning models using publicly available data with curious students or researchers and contribute to open science and open-source modeling. I am fascinated by the potential of high-dimensional and high-throughput biomedical data.
