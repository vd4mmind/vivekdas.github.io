Here is my small snippet of thought for the day!

I started playing with **Gemini 3, Google AI Studio and, Anti-gravity** to put my ideas into action. I improved my website today to add blogs, built dashboards with Agentic AI. It is a **Biomarker Analytical Dashboard** that can enable power calculation as well for experimental design while planning trials or observational research experiments. &#x1F60A;

**Check out the details below and try my new BioTrial Analytics Dashboard**

It is a comprehensive dashboard for visualizing clinical trial biomarker data and planning statistical power.

You can find it [here](https://biotrial-analytics-334146290048.us-west1.run.app/) with all relevant details.
